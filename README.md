This repository includes:

* tidy_data.txt - The final product obtained from a transformation of the UCI HAR dataset

* CodeBook.md - a code book with two sections, Study Design, explaining the original experiment                 from which the UCI HAR dataset was generated, and a Code Book section, divided                   into Variables, a subsection describing all the variables present in the final                   dataset, and Transformations, a subsection describing all the transformations                    performed on the original files in order to obtain the final dataset

* run_analysis.R - The full script that, when run, generates the tidy_data.txt file from the                        subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_test.txt, X_test.txt and                    y_test.txt files in the original UCI HAR dataset.
